Background:

Cloud storage is a form of internet-based data and file storage service which enables users to store files over the internet with access either over public internet connections or private network connections (IBM, 2023). Users upload files directly onto data servers located worldwide, which then forward these to multiple servers manually or automatically across the internet (Pradhan Kulkarni and BasuMallick, 2021). Cloud services providers own and operate massive storage capacities through multiple data centers worldwide (Amazon, 2023).

Healthcare Data Management refers to the practice of collecting, storing and analyzing healthcare-related data gathered from multiple sources within an organization’s facilities or operations (Kedar, 2023). Management of healthcare data allows hospitals to develop integral views of their patients, tailor treatments to individual patients' needs, enhance communication among staff members and optimize health outcomes (Kedar, 2023). As information technology develops, cloud storage technology has been popularized in the healthcare field, which has a lot of practical functions like Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Electronic Health Records (EHR) management, imaging and diagnostic data storage, compliance and security management, resource and inventory management. With the help of cloud storage technology, hospitals may store a lot of patient data on the cloud without having to buy pricey hardware. Also, hospitals can contract with cloud service providers to handle various infrastructure management and maintenance tasks. This not only lowers expenses but also frees up time and resources so that hospitals can concentrate on enhancing their offerings.

Small healthcare clinics in China are establishments that offer a variety of healthcare services to customers and are often privately owned and run. As the name implies, these clinics are often smaller than larger hospitals. They might be made up of a small group of medical experts or just one professional doctor and one to three nurses. The range of treatments offered might differ greatly depending on the clinic's area of expertise. Some of them would provide basic medical treatment, like intravenous therapy (IV) based on prescriptions from hospitals, or others might have specialized in physical therapy, medical aesthetics, or dentistry. Usually, private businesses, practice groups, or individuals own these clinics. Due to their smaller size, these clinics often provide a more personalized experience. Customers could see shorter wait times and more individualized care from healthcare providers. Compared to large hospitals, smaller clinics are frequently situated in more accessible community locations. Due to their ability to offer more treatment alternatives, small clinics are an essential component of the healthcare system and frequently complement the services offered by large hospitals while reduce the medical stress faced by large hospitals (Tian and Hao, 2019).

This topic was chosen because a number of practical reasons. Firstly, the use of cloud storage technology is becoming more and more common across a range of industries as information technology develops. Especially in the healthcare field, cloud storage technology is presently having a mature adoption on large hospital data storage and management, while it has made a significant beneficial influence (Krishna Keerthi Chennam, V. Uma Maheshwari and Rajanikanth Aluvalu, 2021, pp.215–233). Second, small healthcare clinics is an integral part in the field of healthcare. In order to enhance data management capabilities, small healthcare clinics have to consider data management and storage, just like large hospitals do. The aim of this research is to investigate what are the main barriers and challenges affecting the adoption of cloud storage technology for data management in small healthcare clinics, and how to help small healthcare clinics to address these existing challenges and successfully adopt cloud storage technology for data management, and thus improve their overall capabilities in data management.

Problem Statement:

Today, in the medical environment the ability to access important information at a moment’s notice is highly sought after or even expected (E. Hyson, 2014). The time between researching a patient’s medical history and providing an accurate diagnosis could be the difference between life and death (E. Hyson, 2014). The growth of computer usage and global nature of the Internet has caused Information Technology (IT) to develop faster ways to meet the consumer’s needs (E. Hyson, 2014). However, it is undeniable that small healthcare clinics usually face more challenges than larger hospitals when implementing cloud storage technologies for data management. In order to manage customers’ health records data by adopting cloud storage technologies, small healthcare clinics frequently face resource constraints and antiquated infrastructure. Specifically, due to small clinics often have less resources, such as money, equipment, and staff, manage customers’ health records data may end up consuming a greater share of those resources while being more challenging to handle. Small clinics may find it challenging and time-consuming to deal with the intricate legislation and compliance requirements related to healthcare data management, like Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since patient data can be sensitive and must be protected from unwarranted access or irregularities, keeping its security and privacy safe can be challenging, a data breach may occur to any company which uses a database. Criminals often target businesses with weak security measures, stealing their data for a variety of illegal uses. Due to their limited resources, small healthcare clinics are frequently more at risk of data breaches than larger hospitals (Brunner, 2022). In addition, small healthcare clinics frequently struggle with poor data accessibility and low data management efficiency as a result of obsolete data management methods.

Research Objective:

The primary objective of this research is to investigate what are the main barriers and challenges affecting the adoption of cloud storage technology for data management in small healthcare clinics, and how to help small healthcare clinics to address these existing challenges then adopt cloud storage technology for data management successfully, and thus improve their overall capabilities in data management.

Research Question 1:

What are main barriers and challenges small healthcare clinics facing to adopt cloud storage technology to manage their customers’ health records data?

Research Question 2: 

How to help small healthcare clinics to address these existing challenges?

Preliminary Literature Review:

Healthcare Environment in China:

One of the largest and fastest-growing sectors in China is healthcare. China's healthcare system is expanding quickly along with the country's fast economic development, which is being driven by rising incomes, increased health awareness and an aging population (Huld, 2023). By the end of 2021, China have more than 1 million healthcare facilities, including 36,570 hospitals, 11,804 public hospitals and 24,766 private hospitals (2022 China Health Statistics Yearbook, 2023). The Chinese government is prioritizing the development of the healthcare sector to bridge the imbalance between the supply of healthcare resources and citizens' demand for healthcare (Huld, 2023).

Small Healthcare Clinics in China:

Small clinics are incredibly prevalent in China. According to the (2022 China Health Statistics Yearbook, 2023), it can be seen that the number of small clinics in China in 2021 was 235,279, that demonstrates how important it is to Chinese healthcare system. As far as the current situation is concerned, although the Information and electronic management of medical data has been decent popularized in large hospitals in China, its adoption in the field of small healthcare clinics is still obviously insufficient (Fang, 2020). Meanwhile, Chinese government has been working to integrate healthcare alliances of regional hospital groups to share a common electronic health record (EHR) system, with the aim of reducing unnecessary large hospital visits, lowering overall healthcare costs and improving medical accuracy and efficiency (Fang, 2020). Integration of healthcare data alliances and the use of EHR systems are some of the initiatives aimed at improving healthcare supplement and reducing costs (Liu and Tian, 2021).

Benefits of Integrating Cloud Storage Technology with Electronic Healthcare Record Data:

By adopting cloud storage solutions, the issues of financial constraints and lack of IT professional staff facing by small healthcare clinics can be effectively solved. Masrom and Rahimli explained when using the cloud storage in the healthcare system doesn’t need to have IT Stuff to support the system because all transaction (processing) control by cloud provider (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014). Healthcare system needs innovation to remain timely, cost effective and also efficient (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014). Cloud storage has ability to improve the healthcare system (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014). Healthcare system can use the advantages of various virtual services via cloud storage technology in the cloud and also pay base on consumption (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014). With adopting the cloud storage do not need to pay for purchasing the server and also implementing the service based on the cloud is very cost-effective (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014). In addition, with using the cloud storage doesn’t require employing the IT staff to maintain critical infrastructure and application (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014). So, one of the important benefits of adopting cloud storage is ability to minimize the hardware and software expenditure and also pay based on consuming the service resources, with this condition organization can more focus on the core function (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014).

Compare with the local storage, cloud storage solution could significantly enhance data security in the healthcare field. Through real-time backup, disaster recovery and central storage solution can minimize disruption to patient care in case of hardware failure or data breach. In the existing healthcare system, all data of the hospital kept on the primary server and also copy of them kept on the secondary server but in some case that maybe occur problem and primary and secondary service be fail so the hospital will not able to access to important data, while in the cloud storage, data migrate quickly into the new instance of virtual servers that will be created automatically and all server can be resumed normally (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014).

Also, adopting cloud storage solution could significantly enhance data transmission and sharing capability in the healthcare field. With the cloud storage, hospital has integrated system and all data that store in the cloud have universal and same format, so hospitals in this condition can work closely and data can be easily transferred between them (Masrom and Rahimli, 2014). It could strengthen the connection between small healthcare clinics and large hospital, then make the contribution to the overall healthcare system.

Barriers of adopting cloud storage technology in healthcare field:

Technology Acceptance Model (TAM): Developed by Davis in 1989, the TAM is based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and is specifically designed to model user acceptance of information systems. It helps in the design and diffusion of new technologies by emphasizing users' perceptions of their usefulness and ease of use (Davis, 1989). 

Perceived Usefulness (PU): this refers to the extent to which a person believes that using a particular system will improve their job performance (Davis, 1989). 

Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU): this is the extent to which a person believes that using a particular system will be easy to use (Davis, 1989). These two factors determine an individual's attitude towards the use of a system, which in turn affects their behavioral intentions to use the system, and ultimately whether the new technology will be successfully adopted (Davis, 1989).

Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) is a concept that describes the phenomenon of resistance to change and adoption of new ideas and technologies (Ram and Sheth, 1989). It endeavors to understand why individuals, organizations and societies may be reluctant to adopt new innovations, as well as the factors that influence their willingness to adopt new technologies (Ram and Sheth, 1989). The theory of resistance to innovation identifies several essential factors that contribute to resistance to change, including: 

Perceived threat to existing structures and norms: new innovations may challenge existing structures and norms, which may lead to resistance from individuals and organizations committed to maintaining the status quo (Ram and Sheth, 1989).

Lack of understanding or familiarity: Unfamiliarity with a new innovation may cause individuals and organizations to be wary of embracing it, as they may not fully understand how it works or how it will affect their lives and work (Ram and Sheth, 1989). 

Perceived Risks and Uncertainties: Uncertainties and potential risks associated with new innovations may cause individuals and organizations to be wary of accepting them (Ram and Sheth, 1989). 

Lack of perceived benefits: If individuals and organizations do not see the benefits of a new innovation, they may be less likely to adopt it (Ram and Sheth, 1989). 

Economic and organizational factors: Economic and organizational factors, such as costs and resource constraints, may also play a role in shaping an organization's willingness to adopt new innovations (Ram and Sheth, 1989).

Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) have been used to examine the factors which influence the adoption of cloud storage technologies for data management in healthcare field (Chen, Lin and Wu, 2020). 

Inadequate funding can obstruct the success of any business investment (Sheth, 1987). Similarly, the issue of funding is a major obstacle to the adoption of cloud storage technology in small clinics. Also, the development cost of cloud storage of healthcare data is usually high due to the lack of data standardization and the shortcomings of system connectivity due to the huge volume of data, which indirectly makes it difficult for small medical clinics to afford their initial adoption (Chen, Lin and Wu, 2020). 

Sheth & Ram point out that the extent of technological specialization of target personnel is an important determinant of whether an innovation can be successfully adopted (Ram and Sheth, 1989). However, based on the reality in China, employees in small healthcare organizations usually lack the capability to efficiently utilize cloud storage technology and are unable to fully utilize and adopt cloud storage systems for healthcare data, which in turn leads to degradation of the system's performance (Zeng, Shen and Xiang, 2016). Therefore, the lack of technical expertise may lead to a major hindrance for small healthcare clinics adopting cloud storage technologies for data management.

Trust in cloud storage technology is an important issue in determining whether it is adopted (Sadoughi, Ali and Erfannia, 2019). This is one of the main reasons why many organizations are resistant to using cloud technology, which increases when healthcare organizations move sensitive data and critical procedures to the cloud (Sadoughi, Ali and Erfannia, 2019). In the one hand, this is because healthcare organizations must inform patients that their data is being transferred to the cloud, some patients may be upset about their data is being controlled by a third party, which in turn affects the effectiveness of the clinic and patient satisfaction (Sadoughi, Ali and Erfannia, 2019). On the other hand, healthcare clinics may be worried about the potential abuse of their medical data by cloud storage service providers without the organization's consent, they are seriously concerned about the risk of disclosure of their patients' information and specialty treatments, which could not only be exploited by other competitors, but also induce them to face serious legal problems if their patients' sensitive information is compromised (Sadoughi, Ali and Erfannia, 2019).

These researches show that the enormous beneficials of adopting cloud storge solution in the healthcare field. Cloud computing is an IT service paradigm that can, if used meaningfully, enhance traditional health IT approaches and offer major benefits to the healthcare industry (Gao and Sunyaev, 2019). However, its adoption by healthcare organizations has been accompanied by diverse challenges that could impede its meaningful use (Gao and Sunyaev, 2019). The literature has focused on cloud computing adoption in general, the industrial specificities that influence the decision to adopt cloud computing in the healthcare context have yet to be systematically addressed (Gao and Sunyaev, 2019). Thus, this research will investigate the main barriers and challenges small healthcare clinics facing to adopt cloud storage technology to manage their customers’ health records data, then discuss helping them to address these existing challenges.

Hypothesis 1: 

The main barriers and challenges to obstruct Chinese small healthcare clinics in adopting cloud storage technology to manage their health records data include limited financial resources, lack of technical expertise, concerns about data security and privacy.

Hypothesis 2: 

Providing targeted financial support, offering specialized training programs in cloud technology, and implementing strong security measures can effectively help small medical practices overcome the challenges related to adopting cloud storage technology for managing health records data.
